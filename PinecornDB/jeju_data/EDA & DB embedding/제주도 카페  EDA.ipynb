Would recommend for a nice stop!\\nCute little spot overlooking the water. Lovely gentleman brewing coffee and local authentic drinks. But the little touches and overall atmosphere made for the perfect pause!\\nDelicious wine, we tried both white and red, the owner makes it himself, tastes really perfect. The caf\\u00e9 has a lovely seating area and the seaview. We had wonderful time, highly recommend when visiting the area.\\nEntered the store and was greeted with the smell of aromatic coffee! The coffee tasted as good as it smelled :) Owner was friendly and hand makes the coffee as well as the liquor. If you prefer less acidic coffee, do head down and give this place a visit! Atmosphere was relaxed and by the seaside \\ud83d\\ude42\\nJus drank the house-made Orange Blossom wine\\u2026 it was amazing. Wine is made by the owner himself from fresh orange blossoms that can be found all over Jeju Island in Spring. No regrets coming here. Do drop by when you can. The views are amazing too\",\n          \"you must try their carrot-based drinks and desserts! could feel a bit crowded, but you get a nice view of the sea from the window bar seats.\\nExcellent coffee and cakes!

The drinks taste amazing too! The views are spectacular from the balcony upstairs.\\n\\nSpeaking of the times I regret I didn\\u2019t learn Korean from my family!\\n\\nFeeling like the perfect place to set up my goals for the new year!\\nReview from an American couple in their 20's\\n\\nWe stopped by this little cafe on a whim late at night, and this was one of our favorite little cafes from our whole South Korea trip! We got the little croissant waffle with ice cream, a lemonade, and an iced mocha. Everything was DELICIOUS. The lemonade and the croissant waffle especially are the best we've ever had. Please stop by!\\n\\nThe sweet woman at the front too was so kind to us. If I remember correctly (this was a few months ago), she spoke English which was nice bonus for us. Sitting outside on the top floor patio with the ocean breeze at nighttime will always be unforgettable.\\nThere wasn't that much cafe around. It was two storey cafe with a beach view. The drinks served were so-so. Just a local cafe with nothing distinctive or special.\\nAfter eating the barbecue, we walked a few minutes to reach this cafe! I really like the atmosphere here, it's very relaxing facing the sea view, the coffee is delicious, and the dessert cakes are even more delicious. When I left, I bought their bread and pastries and went back to the hotel for breakfast. It was really good. The bread is really delicious.\\nOne of the earliest cafes in Dodu-dong\\nThe store is spacious and comfortable\\nToday's coffee may be different from time to time, but it is full of sourness and nutty flavor and has a good flavor.\\nParking lot is spacious\\nYou can relax while enjoying the coastal view.\",\n          \"Fresh baked goods, aesthetic dishes/drinks, air conditioned and lovely seating with a beautiful view.\\nIt is not as bad as the reviews. The building is a little worn down but didn't we come here to see the sea?\\n\\nThe chocolate pound cake is really good. Didn't try the drinks so can't comment. A bit on the expensive side but I guess that's the price you pay for the view.\\nNice cafe nice coffee nice view nice desserts. Just i didn\\u2019t want to sit down because the furnitures were worn-down and were dirty.\\nThe attitude of the female staff is rude, maybe that's why ppl prefer to go to the cafe next door.\\nCafe, bakery, coffee roasting with a picturesque sandy outdoor seating area overlooking black volcanic rocks and oceanside. Good quality pastries but at a premium price.\",\n          \"Great vibes, limited food menu but it\\u2019s decent. Coffee was ok - lacked body , slightly acidic. If you don\\u2019t have a Kakao account pls pay at the counter vs the self order kiosk. Slightly pricey , but it\\u2019s a good place to spend the afternoon.\\nPopped in for a quick bite yesterday for a late lunch. Place was pretty crowded, with families having a coffee break with their kids.\\n\\nThe ordering machine requires KakaoTalk (ie local phone numbers) to work, so we approached a staff member to assist with ordering.\\n\\nThe mushroom pizza was pretty good, lots of cheese, which we loved. Definitely not Italy-level, but good cafe pizza.\\n\\nThe financier was pretty hard by the time I got to it (too hard to cut with a fork), so I gave up after a few bites. The tart was not too bad, my partner swallowed it so quick but then he usually does \\ud83d\\ude05\\n\\nMaccha latte was not bad, frothy, and quite sweet tbh. Coffee was okay ig, my partner said \\u201cit lacked body and was slightly acidic\\u201d so take that how you will haha\\n\\nThe surroundings and views were amazing though. The walk in on its own was worth the whole trip, as well as the nature views all around. I\\u2019d say all in, 4.3/5 \\u2b50\\ufe0f rating.\\nCoffee stop along the Jeju Olle route 6. Its abit way off the main road for access.   Fantastic view of the ocean.\\nThe place is fabulous ! Amazing view of the sea in the middle of the nature. The carrot cake is one of the best cakes I\\u2019ve ever had (we came twice just because of it) . The workers are super nice :)\\nWe were there too late to catch much of the beautiful views.\\nBut can feel the beautiful atmosphere in the surrounds.\\nNo more food on display as well, so just ordered drinks and ice cream. Ice creams during winter is very nice!\\nThe cafe itself is very well decorated. I like the trees.

The drinks taste amazing too! The views are spectacular from the balcony upstairs.\\n\\nSpeaking of the times I regret I didn\\u2019t learn Korean from my family!\\n\\nFeeling like the perfect place to set up my goals for the new year!\\nReview from an American couple in their 20's\\n\\nWe stopped by this little cafe on a whim late at night, and this was one of our favorite little cafes from our whole South Korea trip! We got the little croissant waffle with ice cream, a lemonade, and an iced mocha. Everything was DELICIOUS. The lemonade and the croissant waffle especially are the best we've ever had. Please stop by!\\n\\nThe sweet woman at the front too was so kind to us. If I remember correctly (this was a few months ago), she spoke English which was nice bonus for us. Sitting outside on the top floor patio with the ocean breeze at nighttime will always be unforgettable.\\nThere wasn't that much cafe around. It was two storey cafe with a beach view. The drinks served were so-so. Just a local cafe with nothing distinctive or special.\\nAfter eating the barbecue, we walked a few minutes to reach this cafe! I really like the atmosphere here, it's very relaxing facing the sea view, the coffee is delicious, and the dessert cakes are even more delicious. When I left, I bought their bread and pastries and went back to the hotel for breakfast. It was really good. The bread is really delicious.\\nOne of the earliest cafes in Dodu-dong\\nThe store is spacious and comfortable\\nToday's coffee may be different from time to time, but it is full of sourness and nutty flavor and has a good flavor.\\nParking lot is spacious\\nYou can relax while enjoying the coastal view.\",\n          \"Fresh baked goods, aesthetic dishes/drinks, air conditioned and lovely seating with a beautiful view.\\nIt is not as bad as the reviews. The building is a little worn down but didn't we come here to see the sea?\\n\\nThe chocolate pound cake is really good. Didn't try the drinks so can't comment. A bit on the expensive side but I guess that's the price you pay for the view.\\nNice cafe nice coffee nice view nice desserts. Just i didn\\u2019t want to sit down because the furnitures were worn-down and were dirty.\\nThe attitude of the female staff is rude, maybe that's why ppl prefer to go to the cafe next door.\\nCafe, bakery, coffee roasting with a picturesque sandy outdoor seating area overlooking black volcanic rocks and oceanside. Good quality pastries but at a premium price.\",\n          \"Great vibes, limited food menu but it\\u2019s decent. Coffee was ok - lacked body , slightly acidic. If you don\\u2019t have a Kakao account pls pay at the counter vs the self order kiosk. Slightly pricey , but it\\u2019s a good place to spend the afternoon.\\nPopped in for a quick bite yesterday for a late lunch. Place was pretty crowded, with families having a coffee break with their kids.\\n\\nThe ordering machine requires KakaoTalk (ie local phone numbers) to work, so we approached a staff member to assist with ordering.\\n\\nThe mushroom pizza was pretty good, lots of cheese, which we loved. Definitely not Italy-level, but good cafe pizza.\\n\\nThe financier was pretty hard by the time I got to it (too hard to cut with a fork), so I gave up after a few bites. The tart was not too bad, my partner swallowed it so quick but then he usually does \\ud83d\\ude05\\n\\nMaccha latte was not bad, frothy, and quite sweet tbh. Coffee was okay ig, my partner said \\u201cit lacked body and was slightly acidic\\u201d so take that how you will haha\\n\\nThe surroundings and views were amazing though. The walk in on its own was worth the whole trip, as well as the nature views all around. I\\u2019d say all in, 4.3/5 \\u2b50\\ufe0f rating.\\nCoffee stop along the Jeju Olle route 6. Its abit way off the main road for access.   Fantastic view of the ocean.\\nThe place is fabulous ! Amazing view of the sea in the middle of the nature. The carrot cake is one of the best cakes I\\u2019ve ever had (we came twice just because of it) . The workers are super nice :)\\nWe were there too late to catch much of the beautiful views.\\nBut can feel the beautiful atmosphere in the surrounds.\\nNo more food on display as well, so just ordered drinks and ice cream. Ice creams during winter is very nice!\\nThe cafe itself is very well decorated. I like the trees. Too bad it was a cloudy evening day.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uce74\\ud14c\\uace0\\ub9ac\",\n
